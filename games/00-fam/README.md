# Telefactor Game 00: Fam

## Before the game

To review, here's what we're doing:

Readme: <https://github.com/telefactor/telefactor>

### Language: Ruby (2.6)

Before it ever gets to your turn, I would suggest you install RVM or rbenv and Bundler
if you don't already have them set up.

### App
Command line, plain-text I/O, no framework.

An isolted core of the app devoted to the CLI will remain in the source, with tests,
between rounds. It just won't do anything other than say "woopsie" when the important
code is removed.

### Turn order

Turn order was randomly generated and kept secret. Some adjustments were made to
accomodate vacation schedules, but no one knew the whole order.

## After the game

that changed between phases.
